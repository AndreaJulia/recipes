TOTAL TIME: 55 MINS PREP TIME: 10 MINS COOK TIME: 45 MINS
INGREDIENTS:
1 cup dry farro
3 cups vegetable or chicken stock
1 bay leaf
1 (15-ounce) can white beans, rinsed and drained
2 ounces Gruyere cheese, shredded (about 1/2 cup)
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
8 ounces baby bella mushrooms, diced into 1/2-inch pieces
1 medium shallot, thinly sliced (about 1/4 cup)
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 small bunch kale, leaves chopped (about 4 cups chopped)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly-ground black pepper
2 tablespoons finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley
DIRECTIONS:

In a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat, bring the farro, stock, and bay leaf to a boil.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the grains are tender but still chewy, about 30 minutes.
Stir the beans into the hot grains.  Add the Gruyere and Parmesan cheeses and stir until melted.  Cover to keep warm.
Meanwhile, in a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat 2 teaspoons of oil over medium-high heat until very hot.  Add the mushrooms and cook until browned on one side, 3-4 minutes, then stir and cook until browned and tender on the other side, 3-4 minutes more.  Transfer the mushrooms to a warm plate.
Add the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil to the skillet along with the shallots and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add the kale and cook, stirring frequently, until wilted, about 3 minutes.  Season with the salt and pepper.
Stir the kale, mushrooms and parsley into the farro and beans and serve immediately, garnished with extra cheese if desired.
